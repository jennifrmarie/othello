### Othello
Othello Game created with React

### Directions 
Each piece played must be laid adjacent to an opponent's piece 
so that the opponent's piece or a row of opponent's pieces is 
flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's colour. 
All of the opponent's pieces between these two pieces are 'captured' and turned over to match the player's colour.
